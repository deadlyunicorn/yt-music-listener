## YT-Music-Listener
A <ins>CHROME</ins> (based) extension that updates your discord status based on the song currently playing on Youtube Music!

### A few words.
This is a project made for fun and education. This is my first ever chrome extension and it was a fun journey to create it.

### What works
 + Gets song and artist
 + Updates status

### How this works (read before install)

It basically automates your browser to automatically update your status, the way you would manually do it, using some javascript/node.js.  
   
You will have to keep a tab with Youtube Music that is playing music on your browser.    

You will have to have Discord open on your browser as well.

### What doesn't work

+ You can't have the discord tab minimized.
+ The browser window must have discord selected, don't worry it does it automatically until it gets patched.

Possible workaround: Give discord a separate window and resize it to a very small size AND/OR move the browser window to a different workspace. Maybe in the future that won't work as well. 

I have tested this during development on KDE Plasma on Vivaldi browser.

# How to install
( FOR TESTING or to make your own adjustments )
(If you want to simply use the extension you can get it from the Chrome Webstore [LINK TO BE ADDED] )

1. Download the zip.
2. Extract it.
3. Check code and verify it's safe to use.
4. Go to your browser's extension settings.
(shortcut e.g. 'vivaldi://extensions/' ).
5. Enable developer mode.
6. Press 'Load unpacked'.
7. Select the <ins>folder</ins> of the extracted zip.

### Personal Vent

There were 2 things that really exhausted-drained me during working on this project.

1. Trying to update the status value.
2. The for-the-time-being-unfixed submitting the status when page is in the background.

Please enjoy <3>
